# research bio
Cassidy grew up in New York City and went on to attend Wesleyan University where he got a bachelor’s in physics and astronomy in 2022. Following an internship in NASA’s Student Airborne Research Program (SARP), Cassidy decided to pursue atmospheric science research at the University of Arizona earning a master’s in 2024. Under his advisor Dr. Armin Sorooshian, Cassidy studies aerosol particles and trace gases using data from NASA's Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment ([ACTIVATE](https://science.larc.nasa.gov/activate/)). In the summer of 2024, Cassidy researched at Pituffik Space Base, Greenland as part of NASA’s Arctic Radiation Cloud Aerosol Surface Interaction Experiment ([ARCSIX](https://espo.nasa.gov/arcsix/content/ARCSIX)). He was on the team running the Differential Aerosol Sizing and Hygroscopicity Spectrometer Probe ([DASH-SP](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/casei/instrument/DASH-SP/)) on the [P-3 Orion](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/P-3_Orion) aircraft. DASH-SP measures the optical and growth properties of aerosol particles.
